# Colortemp
Redshift - GUI Controller (Stable f.lux alternative for Linux)

Using Python's Tkinter library, and a bit of basic Shell scripting, I came up with a GUI control module for Redshift - the stable f.lux alternative for Linux. There are six presets, and a slider to let the user choose from the entire range of color temperatures for their screen. This package installs redshift and a GUI module to control the same by the name of 'colortemp'.

To install, download and extract contents of tarball anywhere. Execute install.sh. Follow instructions in READ ME file.

Note : Currently installer works only for Ubuntu (up to versions 14.04) thanks to Pyinstaller majorly screwing up on newer distros.
